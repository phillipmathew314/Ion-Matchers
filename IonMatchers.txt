Ion-Matchers is a matching game involving the polyatomic ions of chemistry. 
There will be a grid full of 6 random ions' names to begin with and their corresponding
 formulas. The user must match all of them together, and when the user clears the board, a new set of 6 ions and their formulas 
 will be printed out. If the user matches two squares incorrectly, then they will lose 1 point on their score. 
 The user's final score will be based on how many correct matches the user got minus how many incorrect matches the user got. 
 While the user tries to match the ions, their will be a timer counting down to zero for the desired duration of the game. When 
 the game is over, the score will be recorded and placed into the high scores, if it is one of the all-time top 10 scores.
